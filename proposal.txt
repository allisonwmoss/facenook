* Project 2 Proposal: FaceNook

** Project Description

If you have seen my Zoom profile picture (or the theming of almost all of my homework assignments, for that matter), you will probably know that I'm an Animal Crossing fan. I played the first edition of the game on the Gamecube 20 years ago (a sentence that makes me feel ancient), and have played almost every edition since. According to my Switch, I have logged over 610 hours in Animal Crossing: New Horizons since the day it debuted.

When I found [this API](http://acnhapi.com/doc#operation/get-villagers-villagerID), I knew almost immediately that I wanted to make an AC-themed React app, and specifically one that focuses on the villagers. The app that I propose is a mishmash of Facebook, a PokeDex, and the Animal Crossing universe. [Here](https://acnhapi.com/v1/villagers/317) is an example of the data received from an API call.

***Minimum Functionality
Users will see a list of all villagers and their corresponding icons (or, more realistically, maybe just all of the dog villagers to start--there are over 300 villagers in total). Clicking on a villager's name/icon will take the user to a details page for that villager, which will give information about that villager, such as their photo, species, personality type, birthday, and catchphrase. A nav bar on top of the page will allow the user to return to the All Villagers view.

***Stretch Goals
If time allows, I would love to include search functionality to allow a user to locate a specific villager by name. This would allow me to make the initial landing view a search page instead of just a list of a small number of villagers, and allow the user to find details about any of the hundreds of villagers. Additionally, I would love to include the ability for the user to "friend" or "unfriend" a villager, and see a view of the icons and links to the details pages of all of their "friends".

***Component Hierarchy

App (makes the API call and saves the villagers to state)
    Header/nav
        BackButton (only viewable if on villager detail page)
    AllVillagerThumbnails (receives villager data as props)
        VillagerThumbnail (receives villager data as props)
    VillagerDetail (receives villager data as props)
