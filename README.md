# Facenook

Facenook dares to ask, "What if the Animal Crossing universe had social media?" Users can view thumbnails for 8 randomly-generated Animal Crossing villagers, which lead to a details page for each villager. Users can also search for a specific villager by name. Searching by species or personality type and adding villagers to the user's friends list is planned for future updates.
